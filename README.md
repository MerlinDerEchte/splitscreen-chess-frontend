## what i learned

- chess rules are trickier to implement than i expected
- Sometimes there is no way to dodge vanilla javascript, espacially if a function needs user feedback to continue (pawn development)
- Socket.Io is an awsome library to implement websockets
- The later you start to implement what you designed, the less you will have to rethink later on and hence the faster you will achieve the goal
